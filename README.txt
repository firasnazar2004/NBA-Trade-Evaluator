NBA Trade Evaluator 
My first real project. Thought of it after the trade that shocked the entire world when Luka Doncic got traded to the Los Angelos Lakers. Thought, that's got to be a terrible trade for Dallas, right? Then it occurred to me, why not develop a simple program that rates potential NBA trades and decides who's most likely won the trade.
