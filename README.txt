# 🏀 NBA Trade Evaluator System

It all started after that trade that shocked the entire world: Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. My immediate thought was, "That's got to be a terrible trade for Dallas, right?" That moment sparked an idea: why not develop a program that rates potential NBA trades and determines which team most likely "won" the deal?

This repository now houses an **AI-driven NBA trade evaluator system** I'm developing, designed to assess the fairness and value of basketball trades using real player data, team context, and league-wide metrics. My goal is to provide a smart and realistic analysis of complex NBA transactions.

## 🎯 Main Goal

The core objective of this project is to build an intelligent and realistic NBA trade evaluation engine that:

* **Analyzes Core Player Data:** Utilizes comprehensive **player statistics**, **salaries**, **age**, and overall **team performance**.
* **Incorporates Franchise-Specific Factors:** Considers unique team contexts, including **playoff history**, existing **assets**, and **salary cap space**.
* **Assigns Custom "Star Value":** Develops and assigns a proprietary **"Star Value" metric** to each player, reflecting their impact and desirability beyond traditional stats.
* **Evaluates Trade Impact:** Judges whether a proposed trade realistically benefits or harms the involved teams, providing a nuanced assessment.

## 🧱 System Architecture & Data Pipeline

The system is built upon a robust data pipeline that extracts, processes, and organizes real-world NBA data to power the evaluation engine.

### Data Extraction & Processing

* **Source:** Real-world NBA data from **2010 to 2025** is extracted from the Kaggle dataset: **"NBA Player Stats and Salaries (2010–2025)" by Vivek Vinco**.
* **Cleaning & Transformation:** Data is cleaned and transformed using `pandas` for accuracy and consistency. This includes handling missing values, standardizing column names (e.g., `"FG%"` to `"fg_percent"`), and converting data types (e.g., removing `$` and commas from salary figures).

### Relational SQLite Database

The processed data populates a structured **SQLite database**, which forms the backbone of my evaluation system. The database consists of the following key tables:

* `players`: Stores unique player records with biographical information.
* `teams`: Contains comprehensive NBA team data.
* `player_stats`: Houses detailed season-by-season performance metrics for each player.
* `contracts`: Stores salary information linked to each player and season.
* `(In progress) team_stats`: Will store aggregated team performance metrics per season.

### Data Insertion

* `executemany()` and `iterrows()` are utilized for efficient and optimized data insertion into the SQLite database.

## 🧠 How It Works: The AI-Driven Evaluation Logic

The backend logic reads from the populated SQLite database to perform sophisticated computations and analyses:

* **Player "Star Value" Calculation:** A key component is the calculation of a player's **"Star Value,"** determined by a custom function `f(age, BPM, salary)`. This metric aims to capture a player's overall impact and trade desirability.
* **Franchise Strength Assessment:** The system assesses **"Franchise Strength"** using a function `f(team record, playoff history, roster talent)`. This provides a holistic view of a team's current standing and future outlook.
* **Trade Analysis:** By combining Player "Star Value" and Franchise Strength, the system evaluates the overall fairness and impact of a trade on all involved teams.

For more in-depth details into the logic that goes into trade evaluation, please refer to the `trade_criteria.txt` file in this repository.

### Planned Enhancements

I am continuously working to enhance the system's intelligence and capabilities, with future integrations planned for:

* **Social Media Sentiment Analysis:** Incorporating real-time social media sentiment around players and teams to provide a more dynamic and contextual evaluation.
* **Advanced Analytics Integration:** Further integration of cutting-edge basketball analytics metrics.
* **Frontend Trade Simulation UI:** Development of an interactive user interface to simulate trades and visualize the evaluation results.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

The system leverages a modern and efficient tech stack:

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
    * **FastAPI:** For building a high-performance, asynchronous API backend that will serve the evaluation results and future frontend.
    * **pandas:** Essential for robust data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.
    * **SQLite3:** Chosen for its lightweight, file-based database solution, ideal for development and embedded applications.
* **Potential AI Models:** Exploration and potential integration of advanced AI models (e.g., for sentiment analysis or predictive statistics) to further enhance evaluation accuracy.

## 🛣️ Roadmap & Future Developments

* Complete the `team_stats` table population and integration into the evaluation logic.
* Further refine the "Star Value" and "Franchise Strength" algorithms for increased accuracy and nuance.
* Implement social media sentiment analysis for a more dynamic evaluation.
* Integrate more advanced predictive AI models for player performance and trade outcomes.
* Develop a user-friendly frontend interface for intuitive trade simulation and visualization.
