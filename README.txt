🏀 NBA Trade Evaluator System

It all started after that trade that shocked the entire world: Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. My immediate thought was, “That’s got to be a terrible trade for Dallas, right?” That moment sparked an idea: why not develop a program that rates potential NBA trades and determines which team most likely “won” the deal?

This repository now houses an AI-driven NBA trade evaluator system I’m developing, designed to assess the fairness and value of basketball trades using real player data, team context, and league-wide metrics. My goal is to provide a smart and realistic analysis of complex NBA transactions.

🎯 Main Goal

The core objective of this project is to build an intelligent and realistic NBA trade evaluation engine that:
	•	Analyzes Core Player Data: Utilizes comprehensive player statistics, salaries, age, and overall team performance.
	•	Incorporates Franchise-Specific Factors: Considers unique team contexts, including playoff history, existing assets, and salary cap space.
	•	Assigns Custom “Star Value”: Develops and assigns a proprietary “Star Value” metric to each player, reflecting their impact and desirability beyond traditional stats.
	•	Evaluates Trade Impact: Judges whether a proposed trade realistically benefits or harms the involved teams, providing a nuanced assessment.

🧱 System Architecture & Data Pipeline

The system is built upon a robust data pipeline that extracts, processes, and organizes real-world NBA data to power the evaluation engine.

Data Extraction & Processing
	•	Source: Real-world NBA data from 2010 to 2025 is extracted from the Kaggle dataset: “NBA Player Stats and Salaries (2010–2025)” by Vivek Vinco.
	•	Cleaning & Transformation: Data is cleaned and transformed using pandas for accuracy and consistency. This includes handling missing values, standardizing column names (e.g., “FG%” to “fg_percent”), and converting data types (e.g., removing $ and commas from salary figures).

Relational SQLite Database

The processed data populates a structured SQLite database, which forms the backbone of my evaluation system. The database consists of the following key tables:
	•	players: Stores unique player records with biographical information.
	•	teams: Contains comprehensive NBA team data.
	•	player_stats: Houses detailed season-by-season performance metrics for each player.
	•	contracts: Stores salary information linked to each player and season.
	•	(In progress) team_stats: Will store aggregated team performance metrics per season.

Data Insertion
	•	executemany() and iterrows() are utilized for efficient and optimized data insertion into the SQLite database.

🧠 How It Works: The AI-Driven Evaluation Logic

The backend logic reads from the populated SQLite database to perform sophisticated computations and analyses:
	•	Player “Star Value” Calculation: A key component is the calculation of a player’s “Star Value,” determined by a custom function f(age, BPM, salary). This metric aims to capture a player’s overall impact and trade desirability.
	•	Franchise Strength Assessment: The system assesses “Franchise Strength” using a function f(team record, playoff history, roster talent). This provides a holistic view of a team’s current standing and future outlook.
	•	Trade Analysis: By combining Player “Star Value” and Franchise Strength, the system evaluates the overall fairness and impact of a trade on all involved teams.

For more in-depth details into the logic that goes into trade evaluation, please refer to the trade_criteria.txt file in this repository.

Planned Enhancements

I am continuously working to enhance the system’s intelligence and capabilities, with future integrations planned for:
	•	Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Incorporating real-time social media sentiment around players and teams to provide a more dynamic and contextual evaluation.
	•	Advanced Analytics Integration: Further integration of cutting-edge basketball analytics metrics.
	•	Frontend Trade Simulation UI: Development of an interactive user interface to simulate trades and visualize the evaluation results.

🔧 Tech Stack

The system leverages a modern and efficient tech stack:
	•	Python: The primary programming language.
	•	FastAPI: For building a high-performance, asynchronous API backend that will serve the evaluation results and future frontend.
	•	pandas: Essential for robust data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.
	•	SQLite3: Chosen for its lightweight, file-based database solution, ideal for development and embedded applications.
	•	Potential AI Models: Exploration and potential integration of advanced AI models (e.g., for sentiment analysis or predictive statistics) to further enhance evaluation accuracy.

🚀 Getting Started

(Add clear instructions here on how users can set up and run your project. This should include:
	•	Prerequisites (e.g., Python version).
	•	How to clone the repository.
	•	How to install dependencies (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt).
	•	Instructions on where to obtain the Kaggle CSV data (NBA Player Stats and Salaries (2010–2025) by Vivek Vinco) and how to place it for the script to find.
	•	How to run the data processing script to populate the database.
	•	How to start the FastAPI application.
	•	Any initial test commands or API endpoints they can try.)

🛣️ Roadmap & Future Developments
	•	Complete the team_stats table population and integration into the evaluation logic.
	•	Further refine the “Star Value” and “Franchise Strength” algorithms for increased accuracy and nuance.
	•	Implement social media sentiment analysis for a more dynamic evaluation.
	•	Integrate more advanced predictive AI models for player performance and trade outcomes.
	•	Develop a user-friendly frontend interface for intuitive trade simulation and visualization.
