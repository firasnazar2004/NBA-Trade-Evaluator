Trade Criteria: 
Factors to be considered for the player: 
- avg box +/- 
- salary/contract situation (how likely is the player to resign?) 
- age (prime being 27-31)

Factors to be considered for the franchise: 
- recent playoff history 
- assets to be traded 
- salary cap 
- regular season record 
- realistic playoff contention chances

Player Value will be judged by a variable known as the Star Value that takes into consideration:
i.) BPM (box +/-)
ii.)Salary (in millions of $) 
iii.) Age
The Star Value system will categorize NBA players into different tiers based on their BPM percentile in the league. 
The formula is  SV=BPM×(1+α×f(Age , BPM Percentile))
where : 
	f(Age, BPM Percentile) = Age factor that decreases for older players unless they are in the top percentiles of BPM
	α = Scaling factor to adjust the impact of age (tuned based on testing)

This done so as to not penalize the young superstars of the league in the Top 5% of BPM (like Luka Doncic)  for their age.
The tiers are done as follows:
	- Top 5%  BPM (Superstars)   -> minimal age penalty applied
	- 5%-25%  BPM (All-Stars)    -> mild age penalty applied
	- 25%-50% BPM (Role Players) -> moderate age penalty applied
	- <50% BPM (Bench/Rotation)  -> strong age penalty applied
